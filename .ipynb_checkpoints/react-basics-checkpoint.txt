When creating components, you have the choice between two different ways:

Functional components (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components - more about this later in the course) => const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> } (using ES6 arrow functions as shown here is recommended but optional)

class-based components (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components) => class Cmp extends Component { render () { return <div>some JSX</div> } }
